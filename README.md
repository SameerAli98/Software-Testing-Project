Provided are 3 code files named Lex.java, Parser.java and VM.java

Lex.java takes a filename as argument containing code or uses code.txt file as default.

After running Lex.java, it produces output.txt containing token lexeme pairs.

Then, you need to execute Parser.java which takes those pairs and produce symboltable.txt and tac.txt.

Finally, you need to execute VM.java which takes that three address code and executes it.
